"(A) The error in the measurement of $r$ is $\frac{1}{10} \times 100 \% = 10 \%$. 

To find the error in the measurement of $T$, we need to use the formula for propagation of errors. Let $T$ be a function of $R$, $r$, and $g$ such that $T=T(R,r,g)$. Then, the formula for the fractional error in $T$ is given by:

$$\frac{\Delta T}{T} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial R} \frac{\Delta R}{R}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial r} \frac{\Delta r}{r}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial g} \frac{\Delta g}{g}\right)^2}$$

where $\Delta R$, $\Delta r$, and $\Delta g$ are the errors in the measurements of $R$, $r$, and $g$, respectively.

Taking partial derivatives of $T$ with respect to $R$, $r$, and $g$, we get:

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial R} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{7(R-r)}{5g}} \frac{7}{5} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{7(R-r)/5g}} = \frac{7\pi}{5} \frac{\sqrt{R-r}}{\sqrt{g}}$$

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial r} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{7(R-r)}{5g}} \frac{-7}{5} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{7(R-r)/5g}} = -\frac{7\pi}{5} \frac{\sqrt{R-r}}{\sqrt{g}}$$

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial g} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{7(R-r)}{5g}} \frac{-7(R-r)}{5g^2} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{7(R-r)/5g}} = -\frac{7\pi}{5} \frac{R-r}{g\sqrt{7(R-r)}}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\frac{\Delta T}{T} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{7\pi}{5} \frac{\sqrt{R-r}}{\sqrt{g}} \frac{1}{60}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{7\pi}{5} \frac{\sqrt{R-r}}{\sqrt{g}} \frac{1}{10}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{7\pi}{5} \frac{R-r}{g\sqrt{7(R-r)}} \frac{0.01}{0.55}\right)^2}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{\Delta T}{T} \approx 0.0357 = 3.57 \%$$

Therefore, statement (B) is true, but statement (C) is false.

To find the error in the determined value of $g$, we need to use the formula for propagation of errors again. Let $g$ be a function of $R$, $r$, and $T$ such that $g=g(R,r,T)$. Then, the formula for the fractional error in $g$ is given by:

$$\frac{\Delta g}{g} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial R} \frac{\Delta R}{R}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial r} \frac{\Delta r}{r}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial T} \frac{\Delta T}{T}\right)^2}$$

Taking partial derivatives of $g$ with respect to $R$, $r$, and $T$, we get:

$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial R} = \frac{10T^2}{7\pi^2(R-r)}$$

$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial r} = -\frac{10T^2}{7\pi^2(R-r)}$$

$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial T} = \frac{7\pi^2(R-r)}{10T^3}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\frac{\Delta g}{g} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{10(0.55)^2}{7\pi^2(60-10)} \frac{1}{60}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{10(0.55)^2}{7\pi^2(60-10)} \frac{1}{10}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{7\pi^2(60-10)}{10(0.55)^3} \frac{0.0357}{0.55}\right)^2}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{\Delta g}{g} \approx 0.11 = 11 \%$$

Therefore, statement (D) is true.

"To solve this integral, we can use the property of even and odd functions. The given integral is:

$\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{x^{2} \cos x}{1+e^{x}} d x$

Notice that $x^2$ is an even function and $\cos x$ is an even function. The product of two even functions is also an even function. The denominator $1+e^x$ is always positive, so it doesn't affect the even/odd property of the integrand. Therefore, the integrand is an even function.

For even functions, we have the property:

$\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) dx = 2\int_{0}^{a} f(x) dx$

Applying this property to our integral, we get:

$2\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{x^{2} \cos x}{1+e^{x}} d x$

Now, we can use integration by parts. Let $u = x^2$ and $dv = \frac{\cos x}{1+e^x} dx$. Then, $du = 2x dx$ and $v = \int \frac{\cos x}{1+e^x} dx$.

To find $v$, we can use the substitution $y = e^x$, so $dy = e^x dx$. The integral becomes:

$v = \int \frac{\cos(\ln y)}{1+y} dy$

This integral is difficult to evaluate directly, but we can notice that it is an odd function with respect to $y$. Since the integral is over the interval $[1, e^{\frac{\pi}{2}}]$, which is symmetric about $y=1$, the integral evaluates to 0. Therefore, $v = 0$.

Now, using integration by parts, we have:

$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{x^{2} \cos x}{1+e^{x}} d x = uv \Big|_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} - \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} v du$

Since $v = 0$, the integral evaluates to 0. Therefore, the original integral is:

$\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{x^{2} \cos x}{1+e^{x}} d x = 2 \cdot 0 = 0$

So, none of the given options are correct.",None
"We can start by using L'Hopital's rule on the given limit:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{f(x)g(x)}{f'(x)g'(x)} &= \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{f(x)g(x)}{f'(x)g'(x)} \cdot \frac{f''(x)g'(x)}{f''(x)g'(x)} \\
&= \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{f(x)f''(x)g(x)}{(f'(x))^2(g'(x))^2 + f'(x)f''(x)g(x)g'(x)} \\
&= \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{f(x)f''(x)g(x)}{(f'(x))^2(g'(x))^2} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{f'(x)f''(x)g(x)g'(x)}{(f'(x))^2(g'(x))^2}} \\
&= \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{f(x)f''(x)g(x)}{(f'(x))^2(g'(x))^2} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \cdot \frac{f''(x)}{g''(x)} \cdot \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}}
\end{align*}
Since the limit is equal to 1, we have:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{f(x)f''(x)g(x)}{(f'(x))^2(g'(x))^2} &= 1 \\
\Rightarrow \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{f''(x)}{(f'(x))^2} \cdot \frac{g(x)}{(g'(x))^2} &= \frac{1}{f(2)} \cdot \frac{1}{g(2)} \\
\Rightarrow f''(2) \cdot (g'(2))^2 &= (f'(2))^2 \cdot g(2)
\end{align*}
Since $f'(2) = g(2) = 0$, we have $f''(2) \cdot (g'(2))^2 = 0$. But $g'(2) \neq 0$, so we must have $f''(2) = 0$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f \text{ has a local maximum at } x=2}$.",B
"We have $z = \frac{1}{a + ibt}$. To find the real and imaginary parts, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:

$z = \frac{1}{a + ibt} \cdot \frac{a - ibt}{a - ibt} = \frac{a - ibt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$.

Now, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:

$x + iy = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2t^2} - i\frac{bt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$.

So, $x = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$ and $y = -\frac{bt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}$.

Now, we will analyze each option:

(A) For $a > 0, b \neq 0$, we can find the distance from the point $(x, y)$ to the center of the circle $\left(\frac{1}{2a}, 0\right)$:

$D^2 = \left(x - \frac{1}{2a}\right)^2 + y^2 = \left(\frac{a - 2a^2}{a^2 + b^2t^2}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{bt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4a^2}$.

Since the distance is constant, the points lie on a circle with radius $\frac{1}{2a}$ and center $\left(\frac{1}{2a}, 0\right)$. So, (A) is correct.

(B) For $a < 0, b \neq 0$, we can find the distance from the point $(x, y)$ to the center of the circle $\left(-\frac{1}{2a}, 0\right)$:

$D^2 = \left(x + \frac{1}{2a}\right)^2 + y^2 = \left(\frac{a + 2a^2}{a^2 + b^2t^2}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{bt}{a^2 + b^2t^2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4a^2}$.

Since the distance is constant, the points lie on a circle with radius $-\frac{1}{2a}$ and center $\left(-\frac{1}{2a}, 0\right)$. So, (B) is correct.

(C) For $a \neq 0, b = 0$, we have $x = \frac{a}{a^2} = \frac{1}{a}$ and $y = 0$. So, the points lie on the $x$-axis. So, (C) is correct.

(D) For $a = 0, b \neq 0$, we have $x = 0$ and $y = -\frac{bt}{b^2t^2} = -\frac{1}{bt}$. So, the points lie on the $y$-axis. So, (D) is correct.

"We are given that $\hat{w} \cdot (\hat{u} \times \vec{v}) = 1$. Using the scalar triple product property, we can rewrite this as:

$\hat{u} \cdot (\vec{v} \times \hat{w}) = 1$.

Now, we know that $|\hat{u} \times \vec{v}| = 1$. Since $\hat{u}$ is a unit vector, we have:

$|\vec{v} \times \hat{w}| = 1$.

Let $\vec{v} = v_1 \hat{i} + v_2 \hat{j} + v_3 \hat{k}$. Then, we can compute the cross product $\vec{v} \times \hat{w}$:

$\vec{v} \times \hat{w} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\ 1 & 1 & 2 \end{vmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}((v_2 - v_3) \hat{i} + (v_3 - 2v_1) \hat{j} + (v_1 - v_2) \hat{k})$.

Now, we have:

$|\vec{v} \times \hat{w}|^2 = \frac{1}{6}((v_2 - v_3)^2 + (v_3 - 2v_1)^2 + (v_1 - v_2)^2) = 1$.

Simplifying, we get:

$(v_2 - v_3)^2 + (v_3 - 2v_1)^2 + (v_1 - v_2)^2 = 6$.

This is an equation in $v_1, v_2, v_3$ that represents a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Since there are infinitely many points on this surface, there are infinitely many choices for $\vec{v}$, so (B) is correct.

Now, let's consider the cases when $\hat{u}$ lies in the $xy$-plane and $xz$-plane.

(C) If $\hat{u}$ lies in the $xy$-plane, then $u_3 = 0$. From the equation $\hat{u} \cdot (\vec{v} \times \hat{w}) = 1$, we have:

$u_1(v_3 - 2v_1) + u_2(v_1 - v_2) = \sqrt{6}$.

Since $\hat{u}$ is a unit vector, $u_1^2 + u_2^2 = 1$. Substituting $u_3 = 0$ in the equation above, we get:

$u_1(v_3 - 2v_1) + u_2(v_1 - v_2) = \sqrt{6} \Rightarrow u_1^2 + u_2^2 = 1$.

This implies that $|u_1| = |u_2|$, so (C) is correct.

(D) If $\hat{u}$ lies in the $xz$-plane, then $u_2 = 0$. From the equation $\hat{u} \cdot (\vec{v} \times \hat{w}) = 1$, we have:

$u_1(v_3 - 2v_1) + u_3(v_1 - v_2) = \sqrt{6}$.

Since $\hat{u}$ is a unit vector, $u_1^2 + u_3^2 = 1$. Substituting $u_2 = 0$ in the equation above, we get:

$u_1(v_3 - 2v_1) + u_3(v_1 - v_2) = \sqrt{6} \Rightarrow 2u_1^2 + u_3^2 = 2$.

This implies that $2|u_1| = |u_3|$, so (D) is correct.

Therefore, the correct statements are (B), (C), and (D).",BCD

"Given that the crystalline solid has a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. The cell edge length is 400 pm, which is equal to 4 x 10^(-8) cm. The volume of the unit cell is (4 x 10^(-8) cm)^3 = 64 x 10^(-24) cm^3.

The density of the substance is given as 8 g/cm^3. To find the mass of one unit cell, we can use the formula:

mass = density x volume
mass = 8 g/cm^3 x 64 x 10^(-24) cm^3 = 512 x 10^(-24) g

Since there are 4 atoms in one unit cell, the mass of one atom is:

mass of one atom = (512 x 10^(-24) g) / 4 = 128 x 10^(-24) g

Now, we are given that there are 256 g of the crystal. To find the number of atoms in 256 g, we can use the formula:

number of atoms = (mass of crystal) / (mass of one atom)
number of atoms = (256 g) / (128 x 10^(-24) g)

number of atoms = 2 x 10^(24)

"We have the function $g(x) = \int_x^{\frac{\pi}{2}} [f'(t) \csc t - \cot t \csc t f(t)] dt$. To find the limit as $x \rightarrow 0$, we can use Leibniz's rule for differentiating under the integral sign. 

First, we differentiate $g(x)$ with respect to $x$:

$g'(x) = -[f'(x) \csc x - \cot x \csc x f(x)]$.

Now, we find the limit as $x \rightarrow 0$:

$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} g'(x) = -[f'(0) \csc 0 - \cot 0 \csc 0 f(0)]$.

We are given that $f'(0) = 1$ and $f(0) = 0$. Thus,

$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} g'(x) = -[1 \cdot \csc 0 - 0] = -1$.

Since we want to find the limit of $g(x)$ as $x \rightarrow 0$, we need to integrate $g'(x)$:

$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} g(x) = \int g'(x) dx = \int -1 dx = -x + C$.

We are given that $f\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 3$. Thus, we can find the constant $C$:

$g\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{2} + C = 3 \Rightarrow C = 3 + \frac{\pi}{2}$.

So, $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} g(x) = -x + 3 + \frac{\pi}{2}$. Plugging in $x = 0$, we get:

$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} g(x) = 3 + \frac{\pi}{2}$.

Since we want the answer in the form of an integer between 0 and 9, we can round the limit to the nearest integer:

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$.",5.
"Let $g(x) = f(x)e^{-2x}$. Then, we can find the derivative of $g(x)$ using the product rule:

$g'(x) = f'(x)e^{-2x} - 2f(x)e^{-2x}$.

Since $f'(x) > 2f(x)$, we have:

$g'(x) = f'(x)e^{-2x} - 2f(x)e^{-2x} > 2f(x)e^{-2x} - 2f(x)e^{-2x} = 0$.

Thus, $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, which means that $g(x)$ is increasing in $(0, \infty)$. Since $g(0) = f(0)e^{-2(0)} = 1$, we have $g(x) > g(0) = 1$ for all $x \in (0, \infty)$.

Now, we can rewrite $g(x) > 1$ as $f(x)e^{-2x} > 1$, which implies $f(x) > e^{2x}$ in $(0, \infty)$. Therefore, the correct answer is [C].",C
"To solve this problem, we need to use the conservation of mechanical energy and the conservation of angular momentum.

First, we need to calculate the torque $\vec{\tau}$. Since the force $\vec{F}$ is applied at the origin, the torque $\vec{\tau}$ is given by $\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$, where $\vec{r}$ is the position vector of the body. At time $t=1.0 \mathrm{~s}$, the position vector of the body is $\vec{r}=(1.0 \hat{\imath}+1.0 \hat{\jmath}) \mathrm{~m}$.

First, we need to calculate the mole fraction of liquid A in the equimolar binary solution. This can be done by using the Raoult's law, which states that the vapour pressure of a solution is equal to the product of the mole fraction of the component and the vapour pressure of the pure component.

Therefore, the mole fraction of liquid A in the equimolar binary solution is:

$x_{A} = \frac{P_{A}}{P_{A} + P_{B}} = \frac{45}{45 + 45} = 0.5$

Next, we need to calculate the mole fraction of liquid A in the new solution. Again, we can use the Raoult's law to calculate this:

$x_{A} = \frac{P_{A}}{P_{A} + P_{B}} = \frac{22.5}{22.5 + P_{B}}$

Since we know the vapour pressure of pure liquid A, we can solve for $P_{B}$:

$P_{B} = \frac{22.5}{x_{A}} - 20 = \frac{22.5}{x_{A}} - 20$

Substituting this value of $P_{B}$ in the equation for $x_{A}$, we get:

$x_{A} = \frac{22.5}{\frac{22.5}{x_{A}} - 20 + x_{A}}$

Solving for $x_{A}$, we get:

$x_{A} = \frac{22.5}{42.5} = 0.53$

Finally, we can calculate the value of $x_{A} / x_{B}$ in the new solution:

$\frac{x_{A}}{x_{B}} = \frac{0.53}{1 - 0.53} = 1.11$

Therefore, the value of $x_{A} / x_{B}$ in the new solution is 1.11.",1.11

First, we need to calculate the initial moles of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ present in the cylinder.

$PV = nRT$

$n = \frac{PV}{RT}$

$n_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}} = \frac{1 \times 1}{0.0821 \times 298} = 0.0338 \mathrm{~mol}$

$n_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} = \frac{1 \times 1}{0.0821 \times 298} = 0.0338 \mathrm{~mol}$

Now, we need to calculate the moles of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ present after $\mathrm{Y} \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~s}$.

$n_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}} = 0.0338 - 5 \times 10^{-4} \times \mathrm{Y} \times 10^{3}$

$n_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} = 0.0338 + 5 \times 10^{-4} \times \mathrm{Y} \times 10^{3}$

Now, we need to calculate the pressure after $\mathrm{Y} \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~s}$.

$PV = nRT$

$P = \frac{nRT}{V}$

$P_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{5}} = \frac{(0.0338 - 5 \times 10^{-4} \times \mathrm{Y} \times 10^{3}) \times 0.0821 \times 298}{1} = 0.4372 - 0.0017 \mathrm{Y}$

$P_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} = \frac{(0.0338 + 5 \times 10^{-4} \times \mathrm{Y} \times 10^{3}) \times 0.0821 \times 298}{1} = 0.4372 + 0.0017 \mathrm{Y}$

Now, we need to equate the pressure after $\mathrm{Y} \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~s}$ to the given pressure of $1.45 \mathrm{~atm}$.

$0.4372 - 0.0017 \mathrm{Y} + 0.4372 + 0.0017 \mathrm{Y} = 1.45$

"The power radiated by the filament can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
$$
P=\sigma A T^{4}
$$
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the surface area of the filament, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. Substituting the given values, we get:
$$
P=5.67 \times 10^{-8} \times 64 \times 10^{-6} \times 2500^{4} = 644 \mathrm{~W}
$$
So, the power radiated by the filament is in the range $642 \mathrm{~W}$ to $645 \mathrm{~W}$ (option A).

The radiated power entering into one eye of the observer can be calculated using the inverse square law:
$$
P_{\text {eye }}=\frac{P_{\text {filament }}}{4 \pi d^{2}}
$$
where $P_{\text {filament }}$ is the power radiated by the filament, and $d$ is the distance between the filament and the observer. Substituting the given values, we get:
$$
P_{\text {eye }}=\frac{644}{4 \pi \times (100 \mathrm{~m})^{2}}=5.12 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~W}
$$
This is the radiated power entering into both eyes of the observer. To get the radiated power entering into one eye, we divide by 2:
$$
P_{\text {one eye }}=2.56 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~W}
$$
This value is within the given range of $3.15 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~W}$ to $3.25 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~W}$ (option B).

The wavelength corresponding to the maximum intensity of light can be calculated using Wien's displacement law:
$$
\lambda_{\max }=\frac{b}{T}
$$
where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. Substituting the given values, we get:
$$
\lambda_{\max }=\frac{2.90 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}-\mathrm{K}}{2500 \mathrm{~K}}=1.16 \mathrm{~\mu m}=1160 \mathrm{~nm}
$$
So, the wavelength corresponding to the maximum intensity of light is $1160 \mathrm{~nm}$ (option C).

The average energy of a photon can be calculated using the Planck-Einstein relation:
$$
E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$
where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation. Substituting the given values, we get:
$$

"First, we find the point of intersection of $L_1$ and $L_2$. Solving the system of equations, we get $x=4, y=1,$ and $z=7$. Therefore, the point of intersection is $(4,1,7)$.

Next, we find the direction vectors of $L_1$ and $L_2$. From the equations given, we can read off that the direction vector of $L_1$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and the direction vector of $L_2$ is $\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

Since $L$ lies in the plane containing $L_1$ and $L_2$, its direction vector must be orthogonal to the normal vectors of the plane. Therefore, the direction vector of $L$ is perpendicular to both $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$. Taking the cross product of these two vectors, we get $\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -8 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$. We can simplify this vector by dividing by $-4$, which gives us $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

Since $L$ passes through the point of intersection of $L_1$ and $L_2$, we know that the vector from $(4,1,7)$ to $(\alpha, 1, \gamma)$ is parallel to the direction vector of $L$. Therefore, we can write $\begin{pmatrix} \alpha-4 \\ 0 \\ \gamma-7 \end{pmatrix} = t\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ for some scalar $t$. Solving for $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, we get $\alpha = 4+t$ and $\gamma = 7-t$.

Finally, we use the fact that $L$ bisects the acute angle between $L_1$ and $L_2$. The acute angle between two lines is the smaller of the two angles formed by the lines. Therefore, we want to find the acute angle between $L$ and each of $L_1$ and $L_2$, and then set those two angles equal to each other.

The acute angle between $L$ and $L_1$ is given by $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\|\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\right\| \left\|\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\right\|}\right)$. Simplifying, we get $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{14}}\right)$.

Similarly, the acute angle between $L$ and $L_2$ is given by $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}{\left\|\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\right\| \left\|\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\right\|}\right)$. Simplifying, we get $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{14}}\right)$.

Setting these two angles equal to each other, we get $\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{14}}\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{14}}\right)$. This equation is true for all values of $\alpha$, $l$, $m$, and $\gamma$. Therefore, all of the answer choices are true.

"We know that the cut-off wavelength $\lambda_c$ is given by the expression:
$$\lambda_c = \frac{hc}{eV}$$
where $h$ is the Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $e$ is the charge of an electron, and $V$ is the potential difference between the anode and cathode.

Now, if the filament current is decreased to $\frac{I}{2}$, the number of electrons hitting the anode per unit time will also decrease by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$. This will result in a decrease in the intensity of both continuous and characteristic X-rays.

If the potential difference is increased to $2V$, the kinetic energy of the electrons hitting the anode will also increase by a factor of $2$. This will result in a decrease in the cut-off wavelength by a factor of $2$.

If the separation distance is reduced to $\frac{d}{2}$, the electrons will have to travel a shorter distance to reach the anode. This will result in an increase in the intensity of both continuous and characteristic X-rays.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) the cut-off wavelength will reduce to half, and the wavelengths of the characteristic X-rays will remain the same.",A
"Let's analyze the forces acting on the spheres before and after immersion in the dielectric liquid.

Before immersion:
1. Gravitational force (downward): $F_g = mg$
2. Electric force (repulsive): $F_e = \frac{kq^2}{r^2}$
3. Tension in the string: $T$

After immersion:
1. Gravitational force (downward): $F_g' = mg$
2. Electric force (repulsive): $F_e' = \frac{kq^2}{r^2K} = \frac{F_e}{K}$, where $K$ is the dielectric constant.
3. Buoyant force (upward): $F_b = V\rho_l g$, where $V$ is the volume of the sphere, and $\rho_l$ is the density of the liquid.
4. Tension in the string: $T'$

Since the angle between the strings remains the same, the ratio of the forces acting on the spheres must also remain the same. Therefore, we can write:

$\frac{F_g}{F_e} = \frac{F_g' - F_b}{F_e'}$

Substituting the expressions for the forces, we get:

$\frac{mg}{\frac{kq^2}{r^2}} = \frac{mg - V\rho_l g}{\frac{kq^2}{r^2K}}$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$K = 1 + \frac{V\rho_l}{m}$

Now, let's find the mass density of the spheres, $\rho_s$. We know that $m = V\rho_s$, so we can write:

$K = 1 + \frac{\rho_l}{\rho_s}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$21 = 1 + \frac{800}{\rho_s}$

Solving for $\rho_s$, we get:

$\rho_s = 840 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$

Since the electric force in the dielectric liquid is reduced by a factor of $K$, the electric force between the spheres reduces. Therefore, option (B) is correct.

As the angle between the strings remains the same, the vertical components of the tensions must balance the gravitational and buoyant forces. Since the buoyant force is non-zero, the tension in the strings holding the spheres must change. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect.

In conclusion, the correct options are (B) and (C).",BC

$K_{\mathrm{sp}}(\mathrm{ZnS})=\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right] \times \left[\mathrm{S}^{2-}\right]=1.25 \times 10^{-22}$

Now, we need to calculate the concentration of $\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ in the solution.

$[\mathrm{S}^{2-}]=\frac{K_{\mathrm{NET}}}{[\mathrm{H}^{+}]}=\frac{1 \times 10^{-21}}{[\mathrm{H}^{+}]}$

Substituting the value of $[\mathrm{S}^{2-}]$ in the solubility product equation, we get:

$K_{\mathrm{sp}}(\mathrm{ZnS})=\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right] \times \left[\mathrm{S}^{2-}\right]=1.25 \times 10^{-22}$

$\Rightarrow \left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right] \times \frac{1 \times 10^{-21}}{[\mathrm{H}^{+}]}=1.25 \times 10^{-22}$

$\Rightarrow [\mathrm{H}^{+}]=\frac{1 \times 10^{-21}}{1.25 \times 10^{-22}}=8.00 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{M}$

Therefore, the minimum molar concentration (M) of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$required to prevent the precipitation of $\mathrm{ZnS}$ is 8.00 $\times 10^{-2}$ M.",0.08

The probability of at least 3 successful hits is equal to 1 minus the probability of having less than 3 successful hits. The probability of having less than 3 successful hits is the sum of the probabilities of having 0, 1, or 2 successful hits.

Next, we need to calculate the number of ions present per formula unit of the ionic salt. We know that the salt remains 90% dissociated in the solution, so the number of ions present per formula unit of the ionic salt is 0.9 x 0.0555 mol/kg = 0.05.

Finally, we can calculate the number of ions present per formula unit of the ionic salt. We know that the vapour pressure of the solution is 59.724 mm of Hg and the vapour pressure of water at 35°C is 60.000 mm of Hg. Therefore, the number of ions present per formula unit of the ionic salt is 9.",9
"(A) is true. If $\frac{d E_{c e l l}}{d T}=\frac{R}{F}$, then $\Delta S=-\frac{\Delta E_{\mathrm{cell}}}{T}=-\frac{R}{F}$. 

(B) is true. The concentration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ increases from 0.01 M to 0.1 M, which means that the entropy of the system increases due to the increase in the number of microstates available to the ions. 

(C) is true. Racemization involves the conversion of an optically active compound to a mixture of equal amounts of its enantiomers. Since the number of microstates increases upon racemization, the entropy change is positive. 

(D) is false. The reaction involves the coordination of 3 ethylenediamine molecules to $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ ion, which decreases the number of microstates and hence the entropy. Therefore, $\Delta S<0$. 

Final answer: (A) and (B) are true, while (C) and (D) are false.",AB
